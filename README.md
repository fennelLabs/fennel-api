# fennel-api

**NOTE: The present version should currently use Python 3.8, as all functionality is not validated for Python 3.9 or higher.

fennel-api provides endpoints for retrieving information from Fennel's off-chain messaging service, and will over time grow to add an indexing layer over Fennel-Protocol's blockchain.

To get started on \*nix, create a virtual environment with `virtualenv venv`, activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`, and run the API with `./runner.sh init-all-run`.
